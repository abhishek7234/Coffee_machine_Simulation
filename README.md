# Coffee_machine_Simulation
‚òïÔ∏è Python Project: Coffee Machine Simulation
 I worked on building a simple Coffee Machine simulation using Python to strengthen my understanding of:
‚úÖ Dictionaries & Data Structures
 ‚úÖ Functions and Modular Code Design
 ‚úÖ Control Flow (if/else, loops)
 ‚úÖ Global Variables & Resource Management
 ‚úÖ Basic User Interaction via CLI (Command Line Interface)
üîç The program allows users to:
Choose from 3 coffee options: espresso, latte, or cappuccino
Check available resources using a report command
Insert coins and process payments
Automatically calculate change and update available ingredients
It also includes error handling for insufficient resources or funds and uses structured functions like:
is_resource_sufficient()
process_coins()
is_transaction_successful()
make_coffee()
This mini-project helped me understand how real-world systems like vending machines can be modeled using Python. It was a fun way to apply programming logic in a practical scenario.
